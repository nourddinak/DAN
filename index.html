There is always a risk of technical issues, such as software bugs or potential security breaches. Users must be cautious with wallet security and ensure that their digital assets are properly safeguarded.</li>
            <li>Adoption and Liquidity Concerns: The success of DAN tokens is closely tied to the level of adoption by nashop.shop customers and traders on exchanges.
